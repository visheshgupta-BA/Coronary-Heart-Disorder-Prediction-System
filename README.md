    <h1>Coronary-Heart-Disorder-Prediction-System</h1>
    <p>
      The health industry generates a large amount of data every day, much of which is in unstructured format. Machine learning is necessary to uncover the hidden patterns in this data, as it can reveal the major factors responsible for heart diseases.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A recent report from the World Health Organization states that cardiovascular diseases, or Coronary Heart Disorders (CHD), are among the most deadly disorders with high mortality rates. The medical industry is rich in data, and this data contains hidden patterns that can give new insights into various diseases. Our research work aims to effectively diagnose CHD, which is the most crucial part of a human being. We propose a decision support Graphical User Interface (GUI) using k-NN for predicting CHD. With the help of this system, an expert doctor will be able to make a wise decision on whether further tests are needed for the patient's treatment.

      Currently, patients have to undergo an Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a costly and time-consuming procedure. The limitations of ECG include being a static picture that may not reflect severe underlying heart problems and non-specific abnormal patterns. With the increasing number of CHD cases, treatment is becoming more time-consuming and costly, and the tools available for assessment are limited and not available in small-scale hospitals.

      CHD is a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart's arteries that can lead to heart attack. It is actually a result of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), which is caused by the growth of plaque within the walls of the coronary arteries. The traditional risk factors for CAD include high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, family history, diabetes, smoking, being postmenopausal for women, and being older than 45 for men. Obesity may also be a risk factor.

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we propose a novel predictive model-framework for heart failure diagnosis. Our system analyzes the dataset and provides the best results in terms of accuracy and time complexity. It also provides a graphical user interface that helps both the doctor and the patient get the result of whether the patient is suffering from a heart disease or not. With the help of our system, both time and money will be saved for the patient and the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there are several classification models to help with medical diagnosis and classification of heart patients. The accuracy of these classification models should be acceptable and reliable. In this study, we propose a new classification model that combines three classification models to achieve higher performance while maintaining the advantages of individual classifiers.
    </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      This project presents a novel approach for the diagnosis of CHD that is both accurate and efficient. The use of machine learning algorithms and a graphical user interface makes it user-friendly and accessible to both doctors and patients. The proposed system has the potential to greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of CHD.
